# Why Raddix

Raddix is a React Hooks library that provides accessibility
and behavior for many components of your user interface in Hooks.

## Mission

Throughout my career working as a freelance or in my personal projects
one of the most important and difficult things to maintain are
the implementation of component libraries.

<br />
While it is true that there are different libraries of open code components, they
lack a control over the aspects of representation and styling. Many times having
to adapt to the style solution that uses a certain library.

<br />
Therefore many companies and developers are forced to create personalized components,
which is difficult to do so in a totally functional and accessible way, whether they
do not have the resources or time to prioritize these important characteristics of
the web.

<br />
With Raddix you can implement its own component library obtaining all functionality
and accessibility support for each component. It also maintains total control over
the representation allowing you to design each component as your design system needs.
And also providing control over the style, giving him the possibility of using the
style solution you want.

## Vision

Create a open-source React Hooks library that provides accessibility and total
functionality for its components of your design system.
