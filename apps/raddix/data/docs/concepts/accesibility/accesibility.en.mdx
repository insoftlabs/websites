# Accesibility

Raddix helps you create accessible components, including
full screen reader and keyboard navigation support.

## WAI ARIA

According to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/" target="_blank">WAI-ARIA</a> specification
published and maintained by the W3C, it specifies the semantics for
many user interface controls.

<br />
When we want to create controls that are not supported by the browser or
when we cannot use native HTML controls because we lack a control in the styles,
the use of ARIA is required so that the controls or elements have semantic meaning.

Allowing screen readers and other assistive technologies to understand
these elements. And this is very important as it provides equal access
and equal opportunity for people with disabilities.

<br />
However, Aria only specifies semantics and it is up to the developer to
implement the behavior and interactions with JavaScript.
<a href='https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/' target='_blank'>The WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices</a>
document provides guidance for implementing behaviors for many user
interface controls.

<br />
Raddix provides the semantics and behavior for each component,
simply extend the props returned from the hook into your element.
And you will get functionality and accessibility support for each component.

## Keyboard navigation

Raddix also implements keyboard navigation support following WAI-ARIA's
practical WAI-ARIA authoring guidelines.
