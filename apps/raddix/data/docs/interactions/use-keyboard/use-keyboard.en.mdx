# useKeyboard

`useKeyboard` is a custom hook that handles keyboard interactions

## Features

- It supports key checking, using under the hood the `event.key` property and if you need to use other properties like `event.code` you can change it in the configuration using the `checker` option.
- Propagation is stopped by default if there is an event handler, so that a parent component does not respond to an event already handled by a child element.

## Installation

Install the custom hook from your command line.

```bash
yarn add @raddix/use-keyboard
```

## Usage

### Basic example

In this example pressing a key inside the text field sets a red background color
and releasing the key sets a blue background color.

<CodeBlock folder='use-keyboard' file='example1.tsx' />

### Key verification

This example shows an input element that does not allow semigraphic characters.
Add semigraphic characters to the `useKeyboard` Array so that it does the key checking when the `onKeyDown` event is executed.

<CodeBlock folder='use-keyboard' file='example2.tsx' />

### Global keyboard events

In this example, we will raise an alert when the `a` key is pressed.
In order for the `useKeyboard` hook to detect global events we need to
set the `globalEvent: true` option.

<CodeBlock folder='use-keyboard' file='example3.tsx' />
