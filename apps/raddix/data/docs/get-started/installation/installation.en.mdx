# Installation

Each Raddix hook is installed individually so you can manage
their versions more granularly or adopt them incrementally.
It can be installed using a package manager such as npm, yarn, or pnpm.

## Installing useSwitch

For the example in this guide we will create a switch component
and we will do it with the useSwitch hook, so we will proceed to install it.

<br />
In this case we are using pnpm but you can install it with the
package manager of your choice.

```bash
pnpm add @raddix/switch
```

In the next section we will implement the switch component.
