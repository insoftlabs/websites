# Get Started

In this getting started guide, we'll show you how to create your
own component library with Raddix. You will learn to:

- Install a Raddix hook
- Create a component
- Add styles

## Antes de empezar

We recommend that you have the following installed
tools before you start:

- Node.js and package manager like npm, yarn or pnpm
- React.js to use Raddix in your app.

Having all of the above ready, in the next section
we will start with the installation.
