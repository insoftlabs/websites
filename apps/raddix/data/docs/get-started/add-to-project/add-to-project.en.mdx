# Add to your project

Raddix can only be used in React projects. You can use it in its components
of its web application or adopt them incremental in their design system.

## Installation

You can install Raddix using a package administrator such as NPM, Yarn or PNPM.

<br />
Each Raddix hook is installed individually so that it can administer its versions
individually. This allows you to install only the hooks you need.

<br />
For example, if you want to install the hook for a switch component using PNPM.

```bash
pnpm add @raddix/switch
```
