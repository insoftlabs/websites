title: Usage
description: To start using Radix hooks, you only need React 16.8 or higher. That's right, you guessed it!
---

All Raddix hooks are available on npm and can be found under the scope `@raddix/`, followed
by the hook name in Kebab Case notation. For example: `@raddix/use-fetch`.

## Import

Although each hook has its own module, the default import is not used. Instead, 
the hook is imported directly from the package. For example:

```jsx
import { useFetch } from '@raddix/use-fetch';
```
