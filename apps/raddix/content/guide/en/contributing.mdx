## Existing hooks

Although the functionality of existing hooks may be more than sufficient,
you can propose an improvement to the code if you find redundancies or any optimization opportunities.

## New hook

Before you start creating a new hook, please open an issue to discuss it first and
check if the proposed hook already exists.

The repository has a command line interface (CLI) that will provide
a template for you to start creating your hook.

## New Translation

If you would like to make Radix documentation available in your language,
you can open an issue with the translation tag and you will be assigned that task.
