The following guidelines are designed to help you contribute effectively to the creation of hooks, following the concept of creating zero-dependency modules.

## General Requirements

- Hooks should not depend on any other unnecessary npm modules
- Keep it short and don't add redundant code. Most hooks should be short and concise functions.
- Keep the hook API simple and intuitive
- Avoid multiple arguments or option arguments whenever possible; make it do only one thing
- Write a test for each use case of the hook
- At a minimum, include tests for each example you've included in the documentation
- Make sure to also test the cases that should raise exceptions
- It's better to be too exhaustive than not exhaustive enough
- Write tests that are easy to understand and clearly show what is being tested
- Avoid using the `any` type in TypeScript. Always use explicit types.
