title: Installation
description: Raddix hooks are installed individually. Thus having only the hooks you need, they are also versioned independently.
---

Each hook package is published under the `@raddix` scope followed by the hook name in Kebab Case notation.

<Snippet pkg text='@raddix/<use-hook-name>' />

For example if you want to install the `useToggle` hook, you can use the following command:

<Snippet pkg text='@raddix/use-toggle' />
