description: Raddix is a zero-dependency React hooks library that does only one thing.

## Why did we build Raddix?
Inspired by the concept of dependency-free modules from <a href="https://medium.com/@angustweets/just-a12d54221f65#.ljib0mfr5">this blog post by Angus Croll</a>,
we aim to apply the same principle to React hooks.
Providing each hook independently, allowing you to only install what you really need.

## When to use Raddix and when not to?

While there are great React hook libraries like react-use and usehooks-ts, which allow you to use
only the necessary hooks via tree-shaking, this technique is not always effective.
Many hooks depend on others, resulting in larger code and often only a fraction of the
functionality of each dependent hook is used.

For example, if you only need to use the usehooks-ts `useWindowSize` hook, this hook depends on
`useEventListener` and `useDebounce` to work. Additionally, useDebounce depends on the
`lodash.debounce` package. This is great if you need the `debounceDelay` option that this hook's API provides,
but if you don't, you end up importing more than you really need. Raddix addresses this problem
by providing each hook independently and doing one thing.

In short, Raddix is ​​for you if you need a hook that keeps the API simple and does only one thing.
And it's not for you if you need a hook that does a lot of things and also uses the hooks it depends on.
